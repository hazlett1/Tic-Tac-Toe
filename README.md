# Tic-Tac-Toe
Using a ATMega32-16pu AVR chip I created a functioning tic tac toe game against a cpu using RGB lights and buttons.
The CPU runs off a siumple Min Max machine laerning algorithim that will assest the current moves on the board and predict the best move fo rthe CPU to go based on running every move possible in the game.
